  title = {A copula method for modeling directional dependence of genes.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {225},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genes interact with each other as basic building blocks
	of life, forming a complicated network. The relationship between
	groups of genes with different functions can be represented as gene
	networks. With the deposition of huge microarray data sets in public
	domains, study on gene networking is now possible. In recent years,
	there has been an increasing interest in the reconstruction of gene
	networks from gene expression data. Recent work includes linear models,
	Boolean network models, and Bayesian networks. Among them, Bayesian
	networks seem to be the most effective in constructing gene networks.
	A major problem with the Bayesian network approach is the excessive
	computational time. This problem is due to the interactive feature
	of the method that requires large search space. Since fitting a model
	by using the copulas does not require iterations, elicitation of
	the priors, and complicated calculations of posterior distributions,
	the need for reference to extensive search spaces can be eliminated
	leading to manageable computational affords. Bayesian network approach
	produces a discretely expression of conditional probabilities. Discreteness
	of the characteristics is not required in the copula approach which
	involves use of uniform representation of the continuous random variables.
	Our method is able to overcome the limitation of Bayesian network
	method for gene-gene interaction, i.e. information loss due to binary
	transformation. RESULTS: We analyzed the gene interactions for two
	gene data sets (one group is eight histone genes and the other group
	is 19 genes which include DNA polymerases, DNA helicase, type B cyclin
	genes, DNA primases, radiation sensitive genes, repaire related genes,
	replication protein A encoding gene, DNA replication initiation factor,
	securin gene, nucleosome assembly factor, and a subunit of the cohesin
	complex) by adopting a measure of directional dependence based on
	a copula function. We have compared our results with those from other
	methods in the literature. Although microarray results show a transcriptional
	co-regulation pattern and do not imply that the gene products are
	physically interactive, this tight genetic connection may suggest
	that each gene product has either direct or indirect connections
	between the other gene products. Indeed, recent comprehensive analysis
	of a protein interaction map revealed that those histone genes are
	physically connected with each other, supporting the results obtained
	by our method. CONCLUSION: The results illustrate that our method
	can be an alternative to Bayesian networks in modeling gene interactions.
	One advantage of our approach is that dependence between genes is
	not assumed to be linear. Another advantage is that our approach
	can detect directional dependence. We expect that our study may help
	to design artificial drug candidates, which can block or activate
	biologically meaningful pathways. Moreover, our copula approach can
	be extended to investigate the effects of local environments on protein-protein
	interactions. The copula mutual information approach will help to
	propose the new variant of ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction
	of Accurate Cellular Networks): an algorithm for the reconstruction
	of gene regulatory networks.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: To understand cancer etiology, it is important to explore
	molecular changes in cellular processes from normal state to cancerous
	state. Because genes interact with each other during cellular processes,
	carcinogenesis related genes may form differential co-expression
	patterns with other genes in different cell states. In this study,
	we develop a statistical method for identifying differential gene-gene
	co-expression patterns in different cell states. RESULTS: For efficient
	pattern recognition, we extend the traditional F-statistic and obtain
	an Expected Conditional F-statistic (ECF-statistic), which incorporates
	statistical information of location and correlation. We also propose
	a statistical method for data transformation. Our approach is applied
	to a microarray gene expression dataset for prostate cancer study.
	For a gene of interest, our method can select other genes that have
	differential gene-gene co-expression patterns with this gene in different
	cell states. The 10 most frequently selected genes, include hepsin,
	GSTP1 and AMACR, which have recently been proposed to be associated
	with prostate carcinogenesis. However, genes GSTP1 and AMACR cannot
	be identified by studying differential gene expression alone. By
	using tumor suppressor genes TP53, PTEN and RB1, we identify seven
	genes that also include hepsin, GSTP1 and AMACR. We show that genes
	associated with cancer may have differential gene-gene expression
	patterns with many other genes in different cell states. By discovering
	such patterns, we may be able to identify carcinogenesis related
	genes.},

	activities. Genes with positively correlated expression profiles
	are likely to encode functionally related proteins. However, all

	cellular roles. Thus the coexpression of any two functionally related
	genes may depend on the constantly varying, yet often-unknown cellular
	state. To initiate a systematic study on this issue, a theory of
	coexpression dynamics is presented. This theory is used to rationalize
	a strategy of conducting a genome-wide search for the most critical
	cellular players that may affect the coexpression pattern of any
	two genes. In one example, using a yeast data set, our method reveals
	how the enzymes associated with the urea cycle are expressed to ensure
	proper mass flow of the involved metabolites. The correlation between
	ARG2 and CAR2 is found to change from positive to negative as the
	expression level of CPA2 increases. This delicate interplay in correlation
	signifies a remarkable control on the influx and efflux of ornithine
	and reflects well the intrinsic cellular demand for arginine. In
	addition to the urea cycle, our examples include SCH9 and CYR1 (both
	implicated in a recent longevity study), cytochrome c1 (mitochondrial
	electron transport), calmodulin (main calcium-binding protein), PFK1
	and PFK2 (glycolysis), and two genes, ECM1 and YNL101W, the functions
	of which are newly revealed. The complexity in computation is eased

  abstract = {Statistical similarity analysis has been instrumental in elucidation
	of the voluminous microarray data. Genes with correlated expression
	profiles tend to be functionally associated. However, the majority
	of functionally associated genes turn out to be uncorrelated. One
	conceivable reason is that the expression of a gene can be sensitively
	dependent on the often-varying cellular state. The intrinsic state
	change has to be plastically accommodated by gene-regulatory mechanisms.
	To capture such dynamic coexpression between genes, a concept termed
	"liquid association" (LA) has been introduced recently. LA offers
	a scoring system to guide a genome-wide search for critical cellular
	players that may interfere with the coexpression of a pair of genes,
	thereby weakening their overall correlation. Although the LA method
	works in many cases, a direct extension to more than two genes is
	hindered by the "curse of dimensionality." Here we introduce a strategy
	of finding an informative 2D projection to generalize LA for multiple
	genes. A web site is constructed that performs on-line LA computation
	for any user-specified group of genes. We apply this scoring system
	to study yeast protein complexes by using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	protein complexes database of the Munich Information Center for Protein
	Sequences. Human genes are also investigated by profiling of 60 cancer
	cell lines of the National Cancer Institute. In particular, our system
	links the expression of the Alzheimer's disease hallmark gene APP
	(amyloid-beta precursor protein) to the beta-site-cleaving enzymes
	BACE and BACE2, the gamma-site-cleaving enzymes presenilin 1 and

  month = {July},
  abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov
	chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques
	used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards
	a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with
	incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular,
	the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been
	totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental
	theorem of simulation. There are five completely new chapters that
	cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential
	Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage
	of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters.
	The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and
	its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds
	up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A
	third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety
	of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have
	been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more
	detailed coverage.</P> <P></P> <P>This textbook is intended for a
	second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who
	either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of
	practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles
	behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with
	Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with
	computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary
	concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers
	approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors
	who require the book for a course.</P> <P></P> <P>Christian P. Robert

	cell death or apoptosis. Recent molecular investigations suggest
	that TH regulates metamorphosis by regulating target gene expression

	factors. Cloning and characterization of TH response genes show that
	diverse groups of early response genes are induced by TH. The products
	of these TH response genes are believed to directly or indirectly
	affect the expression and/or functions of cell death genes, which
	are conserved at both sequence and function levels in different animal
	species. A major challenge for future research lies at determining
	the signaling pathways leading to the activation of apoptotic processes
	and whether different death genes are involved in the regulation
	of apoptosis in different tissues/organs to effect tissue-specific
	transformations.},

  journal = {Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {65},
  pages = {53--100},
  abstract = {Organogenesis and tissue remodeling are critical processes during
	postembryonic animal development. Anuran metamorphosis has for nearly
	a century served as an excellent model to study these processes in
	vertebrates. Frogs not only have essentially the same organs with
	the same functions as higher vertebrates such as humans, but also
	employ similar organogenic processes involving highly conserved genes.
	Development of frog organs takes place during metamorphosis, which
	is free of any maternal influences but absolutely dependent on the
	presence of thyroid hormone. Furthermore, this process can be easily
	manipulated both in intact tadpoles and in organ cultures by controlling
	the availability of thyroid hormone. These interesting properties
	have led to extensive morphological, cellular, and biochemical studies
	on amphibian metamorphosis. More recently, the cloning of thyroid
	hormone receptors and the demonstration that they are transcription
	factors have encouraged enormous interest in the molecular pathways
	controlling tissue remodeling induced by thyroid hormone during metamorphosis.
	This article summarizes some of the recent studies on the mechanisms
	of gene regulation by thyroid hormone receptors and isolation and
	functional characterization of genes induced by thyroid hormone during
	Xenopus metamorphosis. Particular focus is placed on the remodeling
	of the animal intestine, which involves both apoptosis (programmed
	cell death) of larval cells and de novo development of adult tissues,
	and the roles of thyroid hormone-induced genes that encode matrix
	metalloproteinases during this process.},

	parameters, which are frequently of interest in family studies, with
	emphasis on covariance estimation. Separate link functions are used
	to connect the mean, the scale, and the correlation to linear predictors
	involving possibly different sets of covariates, and separate estimating
	equations are proposed for the three sets of parameters. Simulations
	show that the robust 'sandwich' variance estimator and the jackknife
	variance estimator for the correlation parameters are generally close
	to the empirical variance for the sample size of 50 clusters. The
	results contradict Ziegler et al. and Kastner and Ziegler, where
	the 'sandwich' estimator obtained from the software MAREG was shown
	to be unsuitable for practical usage. The problem appears to arise
	because the MAREG variance estimator does not account for variability
	in estimation of the scale parameters, but may be valid with fixed
	scale. We also find that the formula for the approximate jackknife
	variance estimator in Ziegler et al. is deficient, resulting in systematic
	deviations from the fully iterated jackknife variance estimator.
	A general jackknife formula is provided and performs well in numerical
	studies. Data from a study on the genetics of alcoholism is used

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: It is an important and difficult task to extract gene
	network information from high-throughput genomic data. A common approach
	is to cluster genes using pairwise correlation as a distance metric.
	However, pairwise correlation is clearly too simplistic to describe
	the complex relationships among real genes since co-expression relationships
	are often restricted to a specific set of biological conditions/processes.
	In this study, we described a three-way gene interaction model that
	captures the dynamic nature of co-expression relationship between
	a gene pair through the introduction of a controller gene. RESULTS:
	We surveyed 0.4 billion possible three-way interactions among 1000
	genes in a microarray dataset containing 678 human cancer samples.
	To test the reproducibility and statistical significance of our results,
	we randomly split the samples into a training set and a testing set.
	We found that the gene triplets with the strongest interactions (i.e.
	with the smallest P-values from appropriate statistical tests) in
	the training set also had the strongest interactions in the testing
	set. A distinctive pattern of three-way interaction emerged from
	these gene triplets: depending on the third gene being expressed
	or not, the remaining two genes can be either co-expressed or mutually
	exclusive (i.e. expression of either one of them would repress the
	other). Such three-way interactions can exist without apparent pairwise
	correlations. The identified three-way interactions may constitute
	candidates for further experimentation using techniques such as RNA
	interference, so that novel gene network or pathways could be identified.},
